## Style Guide

To maintain consistency and clarity across the website, follow these guidelines for writing HTML, CSS, and structuring components.

### HTML Structure

- **Semantics**: Use semantic HTML tags where possible (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation in HTML files.
- **Attributes**: Use lowercase for all HTML tag names and attribute names.
  - Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Portfolio image" />`
- **Class Names**: Use clear, descriptive class names, preferably following a [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) (Block Element Modifier) convention.
  - Example: `.hero__title` for the title in the hero section.

### CSS Guidelines

The project is styled using **TailwindCSS**. However, in the cases where custom styles are added, follow these guidelines:

- **Class Names**: Tailwind's utility-first approach should be prioritized. For custom styles, use class names that are specific and avoid deep nesting.
- **Custom CSS**:
  - Avoid using inline styles. If needed, place all custom styles in a dedicated `.css` file (e.g., `custom.css`).
  - Example of a TailwindCSS class:
    ```html
    <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
      Button
    </button>
    ```
- **Colors**: Maintain the color palette as defined. Use the following colors for consistency:
  - Primary color: `#1A202C` (Tailwind Gray 900)
  - Accent color: `#2D3748` (Tailwind Gray 700)
  - Background: `#EDF2F7` (Tailwind Gray 100)

### Component Naming

Follow a clear and structured naming convention for sections and components:

- **Sections**: Use descriptive and clear names based on content.
  - Example: `hero`, `about`, `contact`, `footer`.
- **Modifiers**: If you have variations of components, use modifiers in your class names.
  - Example: `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`.
  
**BEM Naming Convention Example**:
```html
<div class="hero">
  <h1 class="hero__title">Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
  <p class="hero__description">Full Stack Developer</p>
</div>
```

### Best Practices

- **Mobile-first Design**: Use TailwindCSS's mobile-first approach for responsiveness.
- **Code Comments**: Add comments to sections in HTML and CSS files to make them more understandable.
  - Example:
    ```html
    <!-- Start of Hero Section -->
    <section class="hero">...</section>
    <!-- End of Hero Section -->
    ```
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistency in layout, color scheme, and font usage across all pages.
  - Use Google Fonts (such as `Poppins` for headings and `Roboto` for body text) as defined in the CSS.
  
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize the use of large images and assets for faster load times.
  - Use `.webp` image format if possible for faster rendering.

### Explanation of the Style Guide:

1. **HTML Structure**: Guidelines on how to properly write and organize HTML for better readability, emphasizing semantic HTML.
2. **CSS Guidelines**: Since TailwindCSS is used, the guide focuses on utility-first styling, but also provides rules for custom CSS if needed.
3. **Component Naming**: Suggests the use of the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for class naming.
4. **Best Practices**: Tips on making the website mobile-first, adding comments, keeping consistency, and optimizing for performance.

This will help other developers understand the styling conventions and maintain the consistency and quality of the code across the project.
